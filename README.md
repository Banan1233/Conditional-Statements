## 1- main.py
It contains a simple Python code that enables you to choose the question to be displayed and dealt with

## 2- Q1.py
Q1: In this question, you will make a greeting card using the print command.
At first :
* Print a welcome sentence for the user
* Take the following inputs from the user: name and age
and the title.
* Print the sentence as follows:
![sentence](https://i.ibb.co/bJcW2q9/Picture1.png)
* Use only one print command.
* Make sure that the name variable is text and not numbers that mean "real name".
* Make sure that the age variable is a number.
* If one of the variables is empty or the value entered is wrong, print an error message and stop the program.

## 3- Q2.py
Q2: You will create a simple math program that:
1. You will first take two numbers from the user, and then do a calculation on them.
2. Take the first entry first and make sure it's a number
3. Then show the process offered by the program as follows:
  * "+"
  * "-"
  * "*"
  * "/"
  * "^"
  * "%"
  
4. Save the type of operation to be performed, bearing in mind that the user can enter the serial number of the operation or operation itself.

### Example:
The number 1 is the same as the add operation, if the user enters the number 1 or the + sign, you must save the operation,

5. Take the other entries and check them as in point 2 and print the result.
6. After printing the output, show the other options for the output, which are:
* Round a number, up or down
* Take the number without a decimal point
* exit
7. Type the last sentence.

## 4- Q3.py
Q3: Take 5 numbers from the user, then store them in an array, then print the largest and smallest value without using any of the things that we haven't explained yet.

## Best Regards...
